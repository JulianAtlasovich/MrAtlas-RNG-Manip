TODOs
must:


nice to have:
- remove all the uses of the DB FmDatabase, so it's all consolidated into one. Also check if it's being used inside any loop that could be moved to initial load_dbs
- making it possible to fuse with cards already in the field on the last turn
- performance improvements, more caching and minimize usage of database

DONE
- add duel master k
- making one global reset button to start new duel
- change in last turn to enter opp remaining cards instead of putting the card itself
- on each dropdown of card selection add a default of none selected
- save the deck in browser storage for when I refresh site 
- on mages add dropdown to select between free duel and campaign (to determine default field type)
- add field type dropdown on last turn and using it in calcultions

---
- started the deck count from 1 instead of 0
- convert last turn section into a form so it doesn't update whole app
---
- seed identification section dropdows are now only populated with possible options of cards after 5th
- separated player cards into groups of 5 in seed identification section
- making event tracking simpler by combining events

TODOs
must:
- making event tracking simpler by combining events
- add field type dropdown on last turn and using it in calcultions

nice to have:
- remove all the uses of the DB FmDatabase, so it's all consolidated into one. Also check if it's being used inside any loop that could be moved to initial load_dbs
- adding dropdown for campaign vs free mode (for mages)

DONE
- add duel master k
- making one global reset button to start new duel
- change in last turn to enter opp remaining cards instead of putting the card itself
- on each dropdown of card selection add a default of none selected
- save the deck in browser storage for when I refresh site 
- on mages add dropdown to select between free duel and campaign (to determine default field type)

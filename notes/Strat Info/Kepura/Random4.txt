Meadow Manip Adjustments
------------------------

If you win Shadow Specter at the end of the Low Meadow Mage duel, you must determine which frame you actually ended on. To do this:

- If you drew 1 MBD in the opening hand and not 2, you are on frame 32352.

- If you drew 2 MBDs in the opening hand of the duel, you can still be on one of two frames. To determine which one, you can do one of two things:
    1.) Was the last card in your opening hand a card that appears early in the alphabet or late? If it appears early, you are on frame 32327. Late is 32352.

    2.) What was the second card played by Meadow Mage? If it was a Mercury (Swamp Battleguard), you're on frame 32327. If it was another Jupiter (Nekogal), you're on frame 32352.

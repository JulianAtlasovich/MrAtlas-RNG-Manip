If you win Firewing Pegasus, you are on one of two frames. If Meadow Mage opened with a Jupiter, you're on 35589. If he opened with a Mercury, it is still unknown, so you must look at the second card. If his second card was a Mercury as well, you are on 35589. However, if Meadow Mage opens with a Mercury and plays a Sun second turn, you're on frame 35557.
